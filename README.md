# 2D Retro Game Simulated Version ðŸŽ®

## Overview

This project is a 2D retro-style game simulation built in Java. It features a player character, NPCs, monsters, interactive objects, and a dynamic game environment. The game uses a tile-based system for rendering the world and includes various game states such as title, play, pause, dialogue, and more.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the main class to start the game.

## Features

- **Player Character**: Control a character with various actions like movement, attacking, and interacting with objects.
- **NPCs and Monsters**: Interact with non-player characters and battle monsters.
- **Interactive Objects**: Collect items, open chests, and use various objects throughout the game.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Experience a changing game environment with day and night cycles.
- **AI Pathfinding**: Monsters and NPCs use AI to navigate the game world.

## AI Mode

The game includes an AI mode that utilizes Deep Q-Network (DQN) for decision-making. The AI agent can interact with the game environment, making decisions based on the current state of the game. The AI functionality is implemented in the following files:

- **DQNagent.java**: Implements the Deep Q-Network agent that learns to make decisions based on rewards and penalties.
- **GameEnvironment.java**: Manages the game environment for the AI, including player position, monsters, rewards, and goals.

### How to Use AI Mode

1. Ensure the AI mode is enabled in the game settings.
2. The AI agent will automatically take control of the player character, making decisions based on its learned behavior.
3. Observe the AI's performance and adjust parameters as needed for optimal gameplay.
